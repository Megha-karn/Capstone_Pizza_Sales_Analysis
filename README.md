![pizza_sales_analysis](images/pizza1.png)
## üìä Project Overview
This project involves a detailed analysis of pizza sales data to uncover key business insights using **SQL** for data aggregation and **Power BI** for interactive visualisation. The goal is to evaluate sales performance, identify product trends, and understand customer behaviour to support strategic business decisions.

### üß† Objectives
* Calculate core Key Performance Indicators (**KPIs**): Total Revenue, Total Orders, Total Pizzas Sold, Average Order Value (AOV), and Average Pizzas per Order.
* Identify the **best and worst performing pizzas** by revenue and orders.
* Analyze sales distribution by **pizza category and size**.
* Evaluate **weekly and monthly order trends** to identify peak and dip periods.

## üßÆ SQL Analysis
The analysis utilises SQL for data extraction and aggregation, forming the foundation for the Power BI dashboard. All queries are contained within the [`pizza_sales.sql`](pizza_sales.sql) file.

### Key Analytical Queries
#### 1. Sales KPIs
* **Total Revenue:** `SELECT SUM(total_price) AS Total_Revenue FROM pizza_sales;`
* **Total Orders:** `SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS Total_Orders FROM pizza_sales;`
* **Average Order Value (AOV):** `SELECT SUM(total_price) / COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS Avg_Order_Value FROM pizza_sales;`

#### 2. Trend Analysis
* **Weekly Trend:** Orders grouped by `order_day` to find peak sales days.
* **Monthly Trend:** Orders grouped by `order_month` to analyze seasonal or monthly performance.

#### 3. Distribution Analysis
* **% of Sales by Pizza Category:** Calculation of the revenue share for each pizza category.
* **% of Sales by Pizza Size:** Calculation of the revenue share for each pizza size.

#### 4. Top & Bottom Performers
* **Top 5 Best/Worst Sellers:** Identification of the pizzas driving the most (or least) revenue and total orders.

## üìà Power BI Dashboard
The insights from the SQL analysis are visualized in an interactive dashboard created with Power BI.

### Dashboard Sections
1.  **Overview Page:** Displays main KPIs and overall sales metrics.
2.  **Category Analysis:** Breakdown of sales by pizza type and size preference.
3.  **Top & Bottom Performers:** Highlights best and worst performing pizzas by revenue and orders.
4.  **Time Trends:** Detailed look at weekly and monthly order insights.



### üìç Key Insights
A few actionable takeaways derived from the analysis:

* ‚úÖ **Classic** pizzas contributed the highest share of total revenue, suggesting they are the core offering.
* ‚úÖ **Large-sized** pizzas were the most preferred by customers, indicating a preference for value or group orders.
* ‚úÖ **Friday and Saturday** recorded the highest sales volume, confirming peak weekend business.
* ‚úÖ **Promotional opportunities** exist during mid-week sales dips (e.g., Tuesday-Thursday) to boost volume.
